Google Fusion Tables to Pretty HTML Table (PHP)

Takes in a Fusion Table and outputs it in to an HTML table that is sortable and searchable with jQuery DataTables.

Demo: http://derekeder.com/fusion-tables-to-html-table/demo/index.php

usage
1. copy source/connectioninfo.php.example to source/connectioninfo.php
2. fill in your Google account info in source/connectioninfo.php
3. customize what table columns you want to show in index.php (lines 39 and 63) or uncomment the block starting at line 93 to just dump the entire table

Note: This is currently using a custom string to csv function to convert the cURL response from Fusion Tables to an array. If you have PHP 5.3+, you should use str_getcsv instead.
